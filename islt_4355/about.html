    <h3> All About Hailey Jessee </h3>
    
    <p> Hello! My name is Hailey Jessee. I am from Naperville, Illinois. I moved to Columbia, Missouri when I was five. This is because my parents wanted to be closer to family.</p><p>I am a Senior at the University of Missouri. I am majoring in Engineering Information Technology. In addition, I am minoring in Psychology at the College of Arts & Sciences. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family. I also enjoy working out, traveling, and shopping.</p><p>I recently studied abroad this Summer. I completed my Capstone project in Dublin, Ireland. While In Dublin, Ireland, I studied Photogrammetry, UI/UX, and Web Development. After I graduate this May, I am moving to St. Louis, Missouri. I am going to work at Boeing. I am a Systems Engineer. I plan on getting a Master's Degree in Engineering Management. I hope to further my engineering education from a management perspective. </p>
