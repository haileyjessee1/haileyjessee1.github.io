    Hello! My name is Hailey Jessee. I am from Columbia, Missouri. I am a senior studying at the University of Missouri - Columbia. I major in Engineering Information Technology and minor in Psychology. I have previous web application development training and experience. I took a computer science course that taught us front-end and back-end development technologies. Additionally, for my capstone project, I developed a website. I worked with WordPress using HTML and CSS. My expectations for the course are to gain knowledge in proper web design techniques. An example would be applying a color scheme to aid in the aesthetic of the overall website. I also expect to grow my knowledge of using GitHub to host our website. I hope to apply what I have learned with web development skills in my future job at Boeing as a Systems Engineer. In my free time, I enjoy working out, shopping, traveling, and hanging out with family and friends.
