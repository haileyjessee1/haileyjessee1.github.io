<h3>Freshman Year</h3>

<p>Starting freshman year,  I was unsure of what I wanted to major in. I changed my 
major twice from Pre-Physical Therapy in the Health Professions school to Marketing in 
the Business school and finally found my passion in Engineering Information Technology 
in the Engineering school. I knew I wanted to challenge myself every day and make the 
world a better place. After taking some entry-level courses, I fell in love with the idea of 
technical project management and focused my studies in that direction.</p> 

<h3>Sophomore Year</h3>

<p>Shortly after, a worldwide pandemic hit, and that was difficult to navigate 
through. All my in-person classes went virtual which was a huge change for me. Being a 
hands-on learner, I had to adapt the way I learned through a virtual sense which was 
intimidating. I found myself to have a lot of success in online courses and found I also 
learn well through visual and virtual learning. I had fewer distractions and really managed 
my time quite well. This was a skill I needed to learn earlier than later especially when it 
comes to managing a team as punctuality is a must.</p>  
 
<h3>Junior Year</h3>

<p>Junior year was the year I really found out who I was and had become a leader in 
multiple organizations. This year, I became a leader in 5 different organizations will all 
very different roles. In these organizations, I was a Secretary, Treasurer, Director, 
Mentor, and Leader. All these roles I wasn’t sure if I could take on however, my 
professors in the classroom encouraged me to try and go for them. Reflecting on these 
terms I served, my confidence in myself and my abilities in being a leader soared 
however, when I decided to study abroad, I was excited but also very nervous about 
such a huge change. I really stepped out of my comfort zone when I studied abroad. 
Immersing myself in a different culture was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that will 
arguably be my most notable experience in college.</p>
 
<h3>Senior Year</h3>

<p>I am now in the final semester of my undergraduate career in college. In 
November of 2022, I accepted a job with Boeing as a Systems Engineer. I will be moving 
to St. Louis, Missouri where I hope to continue my education. I plan on going back to 
pursue my master’s in engineering management to become an Engineering Manager one 
day. Looking back on my college career, If I had the opportunity to change any part of it, 
I wouldn’t. I believe all these events and lessons happened for a reason at the time they 
did and the growth I experienced from it, is incredible.</p> <br><br><br>
